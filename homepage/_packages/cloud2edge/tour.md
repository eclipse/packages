{% alert warning: Under construction %}

This tutorial is still under construction, and not finished yet.
Of course, you are still welcome to try it. Take a look and give some feedback.

{% alertdetails %}
Just be aware that some content might still be missing, change over time
or that you might experience some issues when testing.

## Preparing the environment

The following examples will use information which depends on your
environment. All of this information is listed in this section and will be
set as environment variables so that all commands can easily make use
of those variables. Note that you will need to set the environment variables
in every command shell separately.

{% variants %}

{% variant Kubernetes %}
<br>
Download the [setCloud2EdgeEnv script](../scripts/setCloud2EdgeEnv.sh) and use it
to set environment variables for the Cloud2Edge package's service endpoints.

{% clipboard %}
RELEASE=c2e
NS=cloud2edge
./setCloud2EdgeEnv.sh $RELEASE $NS
{% endclipboard %}
{% endvariant %}

{% variant OpenShift %}
{% clipboard %}
NS=cloud2edge
RELEASE=c2e
DEVICE_REGISTRY_URL=https://$(oc get -n $NS route ${RELEASE}-service-device-registry-https --template='{{"{{.spec.host"}}}}')
HTTP_ADAPTER_URL=$(oc get -n $NS route ${RELEASE}-adapter-http-vertx-sec --template='{{"{{.spec.host"}}}}')

## Publishing telemetry data

The Cloud2Edge package comes with a pre-provisioned example device that we will use to publish
some telemetry data via Hono's HTTP protocol adapter. The data will automatically be forwarded to Ditto
where the device's twin representation will be updated with the data published by the device.

The demo device's digital twin supports a temperature property which will be set to 45
by means of the following command:

{% clipboard %}
curl -i -u demo-device@org.eclipse.packages.c2e:demo-secret -H "application/json" --data-binary '{
  "topic": "org.eclipse.packages.c2e/demo-device/things/twin/commands/modify",
  "headers": {},
  "path": "/features/temperature/properties/value",
  "value": "45"
}' http://${HTTP_ADAPTER_IP}:${HTTP_ADAPTER_PORT_HTTP}/telemetry
{% endclipboard %}

## Retrieving the digital twin's current state

The updated state of the digital twin can then be retrieved using:

{% clipboard %}
curl -u ditto:ditto http://$DITTO_API_IP:$DITTO_API_PORT_HTTP/api/2/things/org.eclipse.packages.c2e:demo-device
{% endclipboard %}

Alternatively you can also use the following command to subscribe to Ditto's
stream of thing update events:

{% clipboard %}
curl --http2 -u ditto:ditto -H "Accept:text/event-stream" -N http://$DITTO_API_IP:$DITTO_API_PORT_HTTP/api/2/things
{% endclipboard %}


## Working with devices

The next sections will create a new tenant and register a device for it.

### Create a new tenant

Create a new tenant named `my-tenant` in Hono:

{% clipboard %}
curl -i -X POST http://${REGISTRY_IP}:${REGISTRY_PORT_HTTP}/v1/tenants/my-tenant
{% endclipboard %}

This should return a result of `201 Created`.

{% details Example of a successful result %}
    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    etag: be547a07-4a03-4c43-a274-d02f63f8d467
    location: /v1/tenants/my-tenant
    content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    content-length: 12
    
    {"id":"my-tenant"}
{% enddetails %}

### Register a new device

Next we can register a new device, named `my-device-1` for the tenant we just created:

{% clipboard %}
    curl -i http://${REGISTRY_IP}:${REGISTRY_PORT_HTTP}/v1/devices/my-tenant/my-device-1
{% endclipboard %}

This should return a result of `201 Created`.

{% details Example of a successful result %}
    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    etag: d48f4e13-b398-4c73-bbc3-5ac97a81b3e8
    location: /v1/devices/iot/my-device-1
    content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    content-length: 17
    
    {"id":"my-device-1"}
{% enddetails %}

### Set device credentials

The device created has no credentials assigned. So it will not be possible for this
device to directly connect to the platform. This is ok for devices attached via
a *gateway device*, but we want this device to be able to connect, so the next step is
to assign a username/password combination:

{% clipboard %}
curl -i -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '[
{
  "type": "hashed-password",
  "auth-id": "my-auth-id-1",
  "secrets": [{
    "pwd-plain": "my-password"
  }]
}]' http://${REGISTRY_IP}:${REGISTRY_PORT_HTTP}/v1/credentials/my-tenant/my-device-1
{% endclipboard %}

{% details Example of a successful result %}
    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    etag: a7edc4b8-701a-4fe1-85c4-1717c0d24562
{% enddetails %}

### Understanding identities

The previous step assigned the credentials of `my-auth-id-1` and `my-password` to the device `my-device-1`.

Please note that there is a difference between the *username* of the device (`my-auth-id-1`) and
the name of the device (`my-device-1`). When connecting to e.g. the MQTT protocol adapter,
you will need to use the fully qualified username of `my-auth-id-1@my-tenant`
(*authentication id* and *tenant name*), rather than just the *device id* (`my-device-1`).

The *authentication id* is only used for the authentication process. Later on, the messages will be marked
with the *device id* and the back end system isn't aware of the *authentication id* anymore.

Of course you may use the same value for the *authentication id* and the *device id*. In this tutorial however,
we use distinct values to show the difference. 

## Next Steps

* Check out the [User Guides of Hono's protocol adapters](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/user-guide/) to learn more about
the device protocols that are supported by Hono.
* Learn about the [Ditto Protocol](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/protocol-overview.html) which is used to interact with the
digital twins that are maintained by Ditto.
