<strong>Eclipse Hono</strong> provides the IoT messaging layer. It allows the devices to connect into the cluster
using various IoT specific protocols (e.g. MQTT). Connections will be authenticated based on data from
the <em>device registry</em>. Messages will be passed through the <em>router</em>, for volatile messages, and through
the <em>broker</em> for persistent messages.
</p>

<p class="border-callout-left" style="border-color: #81aca6;">
<strong>Eclipse Ditto</strong> will tap into the stream of messages, coming from Hono and the devices. It will
pre-process it, so that applications can work with more structured data.
</p>

<p class="border-callout-left" style="border-color: #ff6d6d;">
This enables your <strong>Custom Application</strong> to easily communicate with the devices, using a
structured data model, a scalable messaging layer.
