{% capture main %}

One thing to keep in mind is, that this is a demo to show an end-to-end integration of open source IoT with
Eclipse IoT projects. And it is intended to manage much more than a single device, with a single value. This is
a scalable cloud platform, which is targeted towards more complex use cases. To make it simpler for you, we are
focusing on a very basic use case. Which you can extend, if you like.

## Architecture

But let's take a look at some of the components and think about alternatives.

### The sensor

Bluetooth is used because it is a versatile, but still a low power wireless communication mechanism. You could easily
run this microcontroller on batteries for quite a while.

Using WiFi would increase the power consumption, but allow you to directly communication with the cloud.

LoRaWAN for example would allow for even more power savings, but reduce
the amount and frequency of the telemetry updates. For this example, it would also be challenging to self-host all
the LoRaWAN components.

### Digital twin

Do you really need a digital twin platform? Well, at some point your application needs to structure the data and
understand the structure. History has shown that structuring the data can be a problem, but in most cases isn't a big
one. Aligning on the same structure however is. Not only do data formats changes over time, but also do different
devices and vendors come with different formats. Using a digital twin platform, allows you to normalize the data,
and structure it in the way it is best for your use case.

And once you did that, you suddenly notice that you can work quite differently with your data. Especially if you have
the capabilities that Ditto offers, like listening for state changes, or reconciling actual vs desired state.

Sure you can "manually" do this in a small application. But with that, you just re-create parts of a digital twin
platform. Any in most cases, over and over again.

### MQTT between Ditto and Streamsheets

Instead of using the Streamsheets internal MQTT broker, it would also be possible to use Kafka again as the way deliver
changes from Ditto to Streamsheets, as both projects support Kafka too.

As Streamsheets is the only consumer of the data in this example, we kept the internal MQTT broker of Streamsheets.
Simply because it is Mosquitto, which too is an Eclipse IoT project.

### Visualization

Of course, what also comes in one's mind is Grafana. First of all, most people already know it by now. Second, it is better suited
for time services data. And in this example, we are focusing more on structured telemetry data. True, a single
temperature value isn't that complex. However, you have all the code and tools available to extend this.

## What else?

There are a few more projects and alternatives we could have used. Maybe you can add them?!

### Eclipse Kapua

We deployed the Kura gateway directly using a container. If you read on, there is a reason for that.

However, you could also install Kura directly on your gateway hardware, and have it managed by
[Eclipse Kapua](https://eclipse.org/kapua/).

### Eclipse ioFog

ioFog is an edge orchestration platform. Instead of manually running a Kura container, we could use it do manage
Kura as an edge workload.

We hope we can add ioFog, once version 3.0 is released. We do require some new tweaks, which will only be available
in the newer version.
