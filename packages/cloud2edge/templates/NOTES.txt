Thank you for installing the Cloud2Edge Eclipse IoT Package.

Your release is named '{{ .Release.Name }}'.

It might take some time for all the package's services to start up.
You can check the current status by issuing the following command:
{{ if ( eq .Release.Namespace "default" ) }}
  $ kubectl get pods
{{- else }}
  $ kubectl get -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} pods
{{- end }}

Once all services are up and running, the output should look similar to this:

Once all pods have status 'Running', the Cloud2Edge package is ready to be used.
