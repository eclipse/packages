# Eclipse Hono

[Eclipse Honoâ„¢](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/) provides remote service interfaces for connecting large
numbers of IoT devices to a back end and interacting with them in a uniform way regardless of the device
communication protocol.

This repository contains a *chart* that can be used to install Hono to a Kubernetes cluster using the
[Helm package manager](https://helm.sh).

## Prerequisites

Please follow the instructions provided on the
[IoT Packages chart repository prerequisites](https://www.eclipse.org/packages/prereqs/)
page.

#### Kubernetes cluster

The most basic requirement is, of course, a Kubernetes cluster to deploy to.
Hono's [Kubernetes setup guide](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/deployment/create-kubernetes-cluster/)
describes options available for setting up a cluster suitable for running Hono.

The Helm chart has been tested to successfully install on Kubernetes 1.11+.
However, functional testing of Hono is done with the most recent version of Kubernetes.

#### Helm client

The chart can be installed using Helm versions 2 (2.15 or later) or 3.
Helm 3 is recommended because it doesn't require installation of any
additional components to the cluster like Helm 2 did (in particular the
*Tiller* component).

The command lines used below are based on Helm 3 syntax. Please refer to the Helm 2
documentation for the corresponding Helm 2 command line parameters.

## Installing the chart

Helm can be used to install applications multiple times to the same cluster. Each such
installation is called a *release* in Helm. Each release needs to have a unique name within
each Kubernetes name space.

The instructions below illustrate how Hono can be installed to the `hono` name space
in a Kubernetes cluster using release name `eclipse-hono`. The commands can easily be adapted
to use a different name space or release name.

The target name space in Kubernetes only needs to be created if it doesn't exist yet:

```bash
kubectl create namespace hono
```

The chart can then be installed to name space `hono` using release name `eclipse-hono`:

```bash
helm install --dependency-update -n hono eclipse-hono eclipse-iot/hono
```

## Verifying the Installation

Once installation has completed, Hono's external API endpoints are exposed via corresponding
Kubernetes *Services*. The following command lists all services and their endpoints
(replace `hono` with the name space that you have installed to):

```bash
kubectl get service -n hono

```

The listing above has been retrieved from a Minikube cluster that emulates a load balancer via the `minikube tunnel`
command (refer to the [Minikube docs](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/tasks/loadbalancer/) for details).
The service endpoints can be accessed at the *EXTERNAL-IP* addresses and corresponding *PORT(S)*, e.g. 8080 for the
HTTP adapter (*hono-adapter-http-vertx*) and 28080 for the device registry (*hono-service-device-registry*).

The following command assigns the IP address of the device registry service to the `REGISTRY_IP` environment
variable so that it can easily be used from the command line:

```bash
export REGISTRY_IP=$(kubectl get service eclipse-hono-service-device-registry-ext --output='jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}' -n hono)
```

The following command can then be used to check for the existence of the *DEFAULT_TENANT* which is created as part
of the installation:

```bash
curl -sIX GET http://$REGISTRY_IP:28080/v1/tenants/DEFAULT_TENANT

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
etag: 89d40d26-5956-4cc6-b978-b15fda5d1823
content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
content-length: 260
```

## Accessing the Grafana dashboard

Hono comes with an example Grafana dash board which provides some insight into the messages flowing through the protocol adapters.
The following command needs to be run first in order to forward the Grafana service's endpoint to the local host:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/hono-grafana 3000 -n hono
```

Then the dash board can be opened by pointing your browser to `http://localhost:3000` using credentials `admin:admin`.


## Uninstalling the chart

To uninstall/delete the `eclipse-hono` release from the target name space:

```bash
helm uninstall -n hono eclipse-hono
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

The `values.yaml` file contains all possible configuration values along with documentation.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example:

```bash
helm install --dependency-update -n hono --set useLoadBalancer=false eclipse-hono eclipse-iot/hono
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that contains the values for the parameters can be provided when installing the chart:

```bash
helm install --dependency-update -n hono -f /path/to/config.yaml eclipse-hono eclipse-iot/hono
```


## Prevent installation of Prometheus and Grafana

The chart by default installs a Prometheus instance for collecting metrics from Hono's
components and a Grafana instance for visualizing the metrics on dash boards in a web browser.

Both Prometheus and Grafana are not required to run Hono. The following configuration properties
can be used to prevent installation of the Prometheus and Grafana servers.

```bash
helm install --dependency-update -n hono --set prometheus.createInstance=false --set grafana.enabled=false eclipse-hono eclipse-iot/hono
```

## Using specific Container Images

The chart can be customized to use container images other than the default ones.
This can be used to install an older version of the images or to install a milestone
using the chart. It can also be used to install custom built images that need to be
pulled from a different (private) container registry.

The `values.yaml` file contains configuration properties for setting the container
image names and tags to use for Hono's components.
The easiest way to override these values is to create a YAML file with the following content:

```yaml
deviceRegistryExample:
  imageName: eclipse/hono-service-device-registry-file:1.2.0

authServer:
  imageName: eclipse/hono-service-auth:1.2.0

adapters:
  amqp:
    imageName: eclipse/hono-adapter-amqp-vertx:1.2.0
  coap:
    imageName: eclipse/hono-adapter-coap-vertx:1.2.0
  http:
    imageName: eclipse/hono-adapter-http-vertx:1.2.0
  kura:
    imageName: eclipse/hono-adapter-kura:1.2.0
  mqtt:
    imageName: eclipse/hono-adapter-mqtt-vertx:1.2.0
  lora:
    imageName: eclipse/hono-adapter-lora-vertx:1.2.0
```

The names and tags can be set per component. Assuming that the file is named `customImages.yaml`,
the values can then be passed in to the Helm `install` command as follows:

```bash
helm install --dependency-update -n hono -f /path/to/customImages.yaml eclipse-hono eclipse-iot/hono
```

## Using a production grade AMQP Messaging Network and Device Registry

The Helm chart by default deploys the example Device Registry that comes with Hono. The example registry provides implementations
of the Tenant, Device Registration, Credentials and Device Connection APIs which can be used for example/demo purposes.

The chart also deploys an example AMQP Messaging Network consisting of a single Apache Qpid Dispatch Router and a single
Apache ActiveMQ Artemis broker.

The protocol adapters are configured to connect to the example messaging network and registry by default.

In a production environment, though, usage of the example registry and messaging network is strongly discouraged and more
sophisticated (custom) implementations of the service APIs should be used.

The Helm chart supports configuration of the protocol adapters to connect to other service implementations than the example registry
and messaging network as described in the following sections.

### Integrating with an existing AMQP Messaging Network

The Helm chart can be configured to use an existing AMQP Messaging Network implementation instead of the example implementation.
In order to do so, the protocol adapters need to be configured with information about the AMQP Messaging Network's endpoint address
and connection parameters.

The easiest way to set these properties is by means of putting them into a YAML file with content like this:

```yaml
# do not deploy example AMQP Messaging Network
amqpMessagingNetworkExample:
  enabled: false

adapters:

  # mount (existing) Kubernetes secret which contains
  # credentials for connecting to AMQP network
  extraSecretMounts:
  - amqpNetwork:
      secretName: "my-secret"
      mountPath: "/etc/custom"

  # provide connection params
  # assuming that "my-secret" contains an "amqp-credentials.properties" file
  amqpMessagingNetworkSpec:
    host: my-custom.amqp-network.org
    port: 5672
    credentialsPath: "/etc/custom/amqp-credentials.properties"
  commandAndControlSpec:
    host: my-custom.amqp-network.org
    port: 5672
    credentialsPath: "/etc/custom/amqp-credentials.properties"
```

Both the *amqpMessagingNetworkSpec* and the *commandAndControlSpec* need to contain Hono client configuration properties
as described in the [client admin guide](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/admin-guide/hono-client-configuration/).
Make sure to adapt/add properties as required by the AMQP Messaging Network.

Note that *my-secret* is expected to already exist in the name space that Hono gets installed to, i.e. the Helm chart
will **not** create this secret.

Assuming that the file is named `customAmqpNetwork.yaml`, the values can then be passed in to the Helm `install`
command as follows:

```bash
helm install --dependency-update -n hono -f /path/to/customAmqpNetwork.yaml eclipse-hono eclipse-iot/hono
```

### Integrating with a custom Device Registry

The Helm chart can be configured to use existing implementations of the Tenant, Device Registration, Credentials and Device Connection APIs
instead of the example device registry.
In order to do so, the protocol adapters need to be configured with information about the service endpoints and connection parameters.

The easiest way to set these properties is by means of putting them into a YAML file with the following content:

```yaml
# do not deploy example Device Registry
deviceRegistryExample:
  enabled: false

adapters:

  # mount (existing) Kubernetes secret which contains
  # credentials for connecting to services
  extraSecretMounts:
  - customRegistry:
      secretName: "my-secret"
      mountPath: "/etc/custom"

  # provide connection params
  # assuming that "my-secret" contains credentials files
  tenantSpec:
    host: my-custom.registry.org
    port: 5672
    credentialsPath: "/etc/custom/tenant-service-credentials.properties"
  deviceRegistrationSpec:
    host: my-custom.registry.org
    port: 5672
    credentialsPath: "/etc/custom/registration-service-credentials.properties"
  credentialsSpec:
    host: my-custom.registry.org
    port: 5672
    credentialsPath: "/etc/custom/credentials-service-credentials.properties"
  deviceConnectionSpec:
    host: my-custom.registry.org
    port: 5672
    credentialsPath: "/etc/custom/device-connection-service-credentials.properties"
```

All of the *specs* need to contain Hono client configuration properties
as described in the [client admin guide](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/admin-guide/hono-client-configuration/).
Make sure to adapt/add properties as required by the custom service implementations.
The information contained in the *specs* will then be used by all protocol adapters that get deployed.
As a consequence, it is not possible to use credentials for the services which are specific to the
individual protocol adapters.

Note that *my-secret* is expected to already exist in the name space that Hono gets installed to, i.e. the Helm chart
will **not** create this secret.

Assuming that the file is named `customRegistry.yaml`, the values can then be passed in to the Helm 3 `install` command
as follows:

```bash
helm install --dependency-update -n hono -f /path/to/customRegistry.yaml eclipse-hono eclipse-iot/hono
```

## Using the Device Connection Service

Hono's protocol adapters need a place where they can store information about the connection status of devices.
In particular, this includes maintaining a mapping of devices to the gateway(s) they connect via.

The [Device Connection API](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/api/device-connection/) defines a service interface
that protocol adapters can use to store, update and retrieve such information dynamically during runtime.

### Example Implementation

Hono's example Device Registry component contains a simple in-memory implementation of the Device Connection API.
This example implementation is used by default when the example registry is deployed.

### Data Grid based Implementation

Hono also contains a production ready, data grid based implementation of the Device Connection API which can be deployed
and used instead of the example implementation. The component can be deployed by means of setting the
*deviceConnectionService.enabled* property to `true`.

The service requires a connection to a data grid for storing the device connection data.
The Helm chart supports deployment of an example data grid which can be used for experimenting by means of setting the
*dataGridDeployExample* property to `true`:

```bash
helm install --dependency-update -n hono --set deviceConnectionService.enabled=true --set dataGridExample.enabled=true eclipse-hono eclipse-iot/hono 
```

This will deploy the data grid based Device Connection service and configure all protocol adapters to use it instead of
the example Device Registry implementation.

The Device Connection service can also be configured to connect to an already existing data grid. Please refer to the
[admin guide](https://www.eclipse.org/hono/docs/admin-guide/device-connection-config/) for details regarding the
corresponding configuration properties.


## Enabling or disabling Protocol Adapters

The Helm chart by default installs the HTTP, MQTT and AMQP protocol adapters.
However, the chart also supports deployment of additional protocol adapters which are still considered experimental or
have been deprecated.
The following table provides an overview of the corresponding configuration properties that need to be set during installation.

| Property                     | Default  | Description                              |
| :--------------------------- | :------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| *adapters.amqp.enabled*      | `true`  | Indicates if the AMQP protocol adapter should be deployed. |
| *adapters.coap.enabled*      | `false` | Indicates if the (experimental) CoAP protocol adapter should be deployed. |
| *adapters.http.enabled*      | `true`  | Indicates if the HTTP protocol adapter should be deployed. |
| *adapters.kura.enabled*      | `false` | Indicates if the deprecated Kura protocol adapter should be deployed. |
| *adapters.lora.enabled*      | `false` | Indicates if the (experimental) LoRa WAN protocol adapter should be deployed. |
| *adapters.mqtt.enabled*      | `true`  | Indicates if the MQTT protocol adapter should be deployed. |

The following command will deploy the LoRa adapter along with Hono's standard adapters

```bash
helm install --dependency-update -n hono --set adapters.lora.enabled=true eclipse-hono eclipse-iot/hono
```
