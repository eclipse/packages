Thank you for installing Eclipse Hono.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

It might take some time for all of Hono's services to start up.
You can check the current status by issuing the following command:
{{ if ( eq .Release.Namespace "default" ) }}
  $ kubectl get pods
{{- else }}
  $ kubectl get -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} pods
{{- end }}

Once all services are up and running, the output should look similar to this:

NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-hono-adapter-amqp-vertx-65cfb4d675-g5wn4   1/1     Running   0          5m50s
my-hono-adapter-http-vertx-66bd6bb89c-mng5t   1/1     Running   0          5m51s
my-hono-adapter-mqtt-vertx-765fcd578b-5rl7n   1/1     Running   0          5m51s
my-hono-artemis-f8f7dc7f4-864cj               1/1     Running   0          5m51s
my-hono-dispatch-router-6c77dc78bd-hjn4l      1/1     Running   0          5m51s
my-hono-service-auth-84d9695cfc-5wlfh         1/1     Running   0          5m51s
my-hono-service-device-registry-0             1/1     Running   0          5m51s

Once all pods have status 'RUNNING', Hono is ready to be used.
