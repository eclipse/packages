# Hawkbit Update Server

## Introduction

[Eclipse hawkBitâ„¢](https://www.eclipse.org/hawkbit/) is a domain independent back-end framework for rolling out software updates to constrained edge devices as well as more powerful controllers and gateways connected to IP based networking infrastructure.

This chart uses hawkbit/hawkbit-update-server container to run Hawkbit update server inside Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `eclipse-hawkbit`, run the following command:

```

## Uninstalling the Chart
